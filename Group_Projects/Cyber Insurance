    <h1>Group Project with Cyber Insurance</h1>
    <p>Embarking on a group project about cyber insurance was an enlightening journey that not only deepened my understanding of a critical aspect of modern business but also honed several essential skills. Working on this project as a team was both challenging and rewarding. I learnt many key skills from my teammates.</p>

    <h2>Belinda L</h2>
    <p><strong>Project Manager</strong> – Having an exceptional project manager who is organized, coordinated, and well-prepared truly makes a significant difference. She guided me through my first project run-through, setting clear expectations and standards that I aspire to meet in all my future project plans.</p>

    <h2>Alissa Borg</h2>
    <p><strong>Team Member - PDF and Excel Extraordinaire</strong> – Alissa has taught me numerous skills related to presenting, structuring, and refining documentation for presentations. Her insights into analytical skills have significantly helped me develop my own.</p>

    <h2>Margeaux P</h2>
    <p><strong>Team Member</strong> – A critical thinker and terminology expert. Margaux has taught me many words and terms that I previously had little knowledge of. She has always been supportive and non-judgmental, helping me to improve my skills significantly.</p>

    <h2>William Duncan</h2>
    <p><strong>Team Member</strong> – A deep thinker and technology expert. William has taught me numerous small skills that are often taken for granted in daily life. He has explained information clearly and encouraged me to ask questions without fear of judgment. No question was ever considered stupid.</p>

    <p>I have thoroughly enjoyed this project and am saddened that it has come to an end. However, the life skills and knowledge I have gained will stay with me. Thank you to the Cyber Audit Team for this incredible opportunity to learn, grow, and develop. I found that working in a group can be challenging, but it also offers a unique opportunity to learn from others and grow together. This project was a testament to the power of collaboration and the importance of cyber insurance in today’s digital age.</p>
