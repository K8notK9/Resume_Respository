# SolarWinds Supply Chain Attack Report

## Overview
SolarWinds, a leading provider of IT management software, suffered a major supply chain attack in 2020. The attackers infiltrated their software development process and inserted malicious code into their Orion platform, a widely used network monitoring and management tool. The compromised software was then distributed to thousands of SolarWinds customers, including government agencies and Fortune 500 companies, leading to a widespread and sophisticated cyber espionage campaign (Tuffley, D., 2007).

## Risk Management Framework
The NIST Risk Management Framework (RMF) provides structured approaches for identifying, assessing, and mitigating risks within organizations. The framework's core functions are identify, protect, detect, respond, and recover. The process to identify the risk using the NIST framework involves four steps (NIST, 2023):
1. **Risk Framing:** Determine the level of risk that the organization is willing to accept within specified constraints and in alignment with upper management objectives.
2. **Risk Assessment:** Evaluate the significance of various assets, identify the protected assets, and assess the extent of their vulnerability.
3. **Response to Identified Risks:** Develop contingency plans if the identified risks manifest into adverse situations.
4. **Ongoing Risk Monitoring:** Regularly review risk management plans to ensure their effective implementation and update them as conditions evolve based on continuous or periodic monitoring.

Proactively investigating cyber risk levels would have allowed SolarWinds to identify and prevent the incident. This includes inventorying every physical device and system, assessing hardware and software requirements, and implementing updates to prevent further risks (Tuffley, D., 2007).

## Vulnerability Management
Vulnerability Management involves identifying, managing, and mitigating risks in a company’s network. It includes using tools to scan assets for weaknesses, threats, or risks. This is crucial for mitigating supply chain attacks like the one SolarWinds experienced (NIST, 2023). The steps to improve vulnerability management are:
1. **Identify Potential Risk Factors:** Focus on higher and important risks first.
2. **Implement Software Patches and Configuration Changes:** Deploy compensating controls or upgrade to newer versions of software or hardware.
3. **Test and Deploy Remediation Measures:** Ensure thorough testing before rolling out changes.
4. **Establish Regular Scans and Assessments:** Maintain a robust security posture through regular vulnerability scans and risk assessments (Tuffley, D., 2007).

## Third-Party Risk Management
Third-Party Risk Management (TPRM) focuses on identifying, assessing, and mitigating risks associated with third-party vendors, suppliers, and service providers. Key steps include:
1. **Identify Cyber Risks During Onboarding:** Conduct a cyber risk assessment before entering a contract with a vendor.
2. **Scale Vendor Risk Management with Automation:** Automate vendor risk management tasks to reduce manual handling.
3. **Continuously Monitor Supply Chain Risks:** Regularly manage and maintain vulnerability management.
4. **Share Findings with Vendors:** Ensure open communication and collaboration.
5. **Report on Supply Chain Risks:** Make the entire company aware of the steps and processes to report a supply chain attack (Tuffley, D., 2007).

## Risk Identification, Assessment, and Treatment
The supply chain risk involved hackers infiltrating the software development processes of a third-party company, allowing them to insert malicious code into the Orion platform. This compromised software was distributed to thousands of customers, leading to data manipulation and transmission of malicious malware. Preventative measures include monitoring third-party adherence to industry standards, conducting regular audits, sandbox testing, user awareness training, and integrating security practices within the company (Tuffley, D., 2007).

## Recommendations
To prevent future incidents, SolarWinds should:
1. Implement a Risk Management Framework to address identified risks.
2. Incorporate Vulnerability Management to assess current vulnerabilities.
3. Embrace Third-Party Risk Management to thoroughly vet vulnerabilities in collaborating companies.

## Conclusion
SolarWinds needs to recover from this cyber-attack and reposition itself. Implementing the recommendations will help ensure a smoother transition and prevent future attacks.
